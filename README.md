## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-RESTx Loguru
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5.  **Open your browser:**
    -   **Web Interface:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the web calculator.
    -   **Swagger UI:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/` to access the automatically generated API documentation and try out the API endpoints.

## Usage

### Web Interface

Simply enter two numbers in the respective fields, select the desired operation from the dropdown, and click the "Calculate" button to get the result. The application will handle any invalid input (non-numeric values) and division by zero errors, displaying an appropriate message.

### REST API

The calculator exposes a RESTful API under the `/api` prefix. You can interact with the calculator programmatically by sending a `POST` request to the `/api/calculate/` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the following fields:

-   `num1`: The first number (as a string).
-   `num2`: The second number (as a string).
-   `operation`: The operation to perform (a string: "add", "subtract", "multiply", or "divide").

**Example using `curl`:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"num1": "10", "num2": "5", "operation": "add"}' [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/calculate/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/calculate/)
```
